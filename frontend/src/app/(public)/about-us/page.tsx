              My name is [name], and I am the sole developer behind this platform.
              Fleeti was born out of a simple yet powerful idea:
              <strong>
                { " " }to give users control over their shared content and
                ensure that it only stays available for as long as needed
              </strong>.

                As a solo developer, I’m passionate about building tools that simplify life and solve real-world problems.
                With Fleeti, my goal is to provide a secure, user-friendly solution for temporary content sharing.
                Whether you’re sending confidential files, temporary links, or time-sensitive messages,
                Fleeti helps ensure that your information disappears when it’s no longer needed.

              <p className="mt-8">
                From brainstorming initial concepts to writing each line of code, every aspect of Fleeti is a reflection
                of my commitment to creating a seamless user experience. As both the developer and the user, I understand the
                importance of keeping things simple yet powerful, and I’ve worked hard to ensure that Fleeti is intuitive,
                reliable, and adaptable to your needs.

                Building this platform has been an incredible journey, and I’m excited to keep expanding and
                improving it with new features based on user feedback. Thank you for being a part of this journey,
                and I hope Fleeti makes your digital sharing safer and more manageable.
